# Dont waste your time with loveable.dev

1. Current state of transformer code generation:
- Transformers are incapable of accurate reasoning or planning
- With explicit specifications AI can generate or update applications
2. For all steps in AI planning:
- AI drafts each step
- Human validates each step with meticulos and comprehensive review to find all AI plannign errors and fix them
- if source code requirements are explicit then LLM is capable of accurate automated creation according to the schema
- if source code requirements are explicit then LLM is capable of accurate automated unit, integraion and end-to-end testing
3. It is good to have medium term goals - like improving AI systems so that high accuarcy planning can eventually occur without human assistance

## No need to give them $6 billion any more for such a basic product. Loveable has:
- one programming language (slower, more complex, less secure, single threaded)
- no mobile support
- no smart watch support
- no smart tv support
- no embedded microcontroller support
- no game console support
- no car operating system support
- no comprehensive ultra high accuracy application and service planning systems
- no comprehensive lint, complexity and security verification
- no comprehensive unit and integration testing 
- no comprehensive runtime end to end testing
